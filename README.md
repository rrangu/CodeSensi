# 🧠 StockSensei AI

Advanced AI-powered stock analysis platform with pattern recognition, sentiment analysis, and portfolio tracking.

## 🚧 Current Development Status

**⚠️ Development Phase**: This application is currently in active development. While the core functionality and AI analysis engine are fully implemented, the app currently uses fallback data due to API deployment constraints.

### 📊 What's Working:
- ✅ **Complete UI/UX**: Full-featured interface with 4 analysis tabs
- ✅ **AI Pattern Recognition**: Head & shoulders, support/resistance, crossover detection
- ✅ **Sentiment Analysis Engine**: Multi-source sentiment scoring algorithm
- ✅ **Portfolio Management**: Add/remove positions, P&L tracking
- ✅ **Interactive Charts**: Price visualization with moving averages
- ✅ **Technical Indicators**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands calculations

### 🔄 Currently Using:
- **Fallback Price Data**: Accurate current market prices (manually updated)
- **Simulated Historical Data**: Realistic price movements for pattern analysis
- **Mock Sentiment Sources**: Weighted sentiment scoring system

### 🎯 Next Steps - In Progress:
1. **🔑 API Integration**: Working on resolving API key authentication and CORS issues
2. **🌐 Production Deployment**: Planning deployment to Vercel/Netlify for full API access
3. **📡 Real-time Data**: Implementing live Alpha Vantage API connections
4. **📰 News Integration**: Adding real news sentiment analysis APIs
5. **🚀 Performance Optimization**: Caching and rate limit management

## ✨ Features (Fully Implemented)

- **🎯 Pattern Recognition**: Automated detection of technical chart patterns
- **⚡ Sentiment Analysis**: Multi-source sentiment scoring with confidence metrics
- **💼 Portfolio Tracking**: Complete position management with P&L calculation  
- **📊 Interactive Charts**: Real-time price visualization with technical overlays
- **🔮 AI Predictions**: Bullish/bearish outlook with confidence scoring
- **🧠 Debug System**: Real-time logging for development and troubleshooting

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stocksensei-ai.git
cd stocksensei-ai
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server:**
```bash
npm start
```

4. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** to view it in the browser.

## 🔑 API Configuration (In Development)

The app is designed to use Alpha Vantage API for real-time stock data. Once deployment issues are resolved, update the API key in `src/App.js`:

```javascript
const ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
```

**Current Status**: API calls work in local environments but are blocked in certain hosted environments due to CORS restrictions. Working on server-side proxy solution.

## 📈 Demo Features

Even with fallback data, you can experience:
- **Pattern Analysis**: See how the AI detects chart patterns
- **Sentiment Scoring**: Understand multi-source sentiment weighting
- **Portfolio Management**: Add positions and track performance
- **Technical Analysis**: View RSI, MACD, and moving average calculations
- **Prediction Engine**: See how bullish/bearish signals are generated

## 🛠 Technologies

- **Frontend**: React 18 with Hooks
- **Visualization**: Recharts for interactive charts
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with gradient themes
- **APIs**: Alpha Vantage (in development)
- **Deployment**: Planned for Vercel/Netlify
